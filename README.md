# calorie-counter

Implemented using **ReactJS** and **NestJS** with **Sqlite**.

## Functionalities
### 1. Users should be able to manage food entries
- A user should be able to add a new food entry
- Food entry should contain the following information:
  - Date/time when the food was taken
  - Food/product name (i.e. Milk, banana, hamburger)
  - Calorie value (numeric value)
  - Price of the food
- The first screen a user should see is the list of existing food entries
- User should be able to filter those entries by entry date (date from / date to)
- Please place filtering fields on a screen with a list of previously added food entries
### 2. Calorie limit warning per day
- The daily threshold limit of calories should be 2.100.
  - Ensure the users can see for which day they reached that limit. Also, ensure it is easy to change that limit in the code, per user. You donâ€™t have to create an interface for this purpose.

### 3. Budget Warning
- If a user has spent more than $1.000 per month, please show a warning message to the user saying they reached the monthly limit. Display it the same way the calorie limit warning is displayed

### 4. Admin role with a simple reporting
- Implement an admin role
- Admin can see a screen with all added food entries of all users and manage existing food entries (read, update, create, delete)
- Admin should also see the report screen with the following information
  - Number of added entries in the last 7 days vs. added entries the week before that. Please Include the current day in those stats
  - The average number of calories added per user for the last 7 days
  - A regular user should not be able to access this reporting screen or access its data

### 5. User authentication/authorization
- Token authentication method using *JWT*.
